# televideo-web

A web client to browse RAI's national teletext service, [Televideo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Televideo_(teletext)).

You can tr it over on [my website](https://alfiot.net/televideo/).

This project gets the resources from RAI's own [online televideo browser](https://www.servizitelevideo.rai.it/televideo/pub/pagina.jsp),
but adds some features like skipping empty channels instead of adding random images
and not reloading on every channel change, as well as providing a better user interface.

Also, this project was (admittedly coincidentally) published on Televideo's 40th anniversary! ðŸŽ‰
